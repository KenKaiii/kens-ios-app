# Code Injection
#
# After new code Injection tools there's a hierarchical system of root folders where injection stores it's
# temporary files and instrumented files. If you opt into injection in all apps in your user folder
# (the default behavior), look for .inject in your user folder and add that to your global (user-level)
# gitignore.
